        "When reading the scenario provided, I identified the six entities as customer, enclosure, loyalty program, pet, transaction, and food. Based off of the description, I decided that all entities in the diagram would become connected to transaction, which would be connected to the customer. For customer to loyalty program, I chose optional 1 to 1 because customers can opt into the program. I also connected transaction to loyalty program because one would need to know a customer's purchase history to determine benefits.  I also connected the keys for enclosure, pet, and food to transaction because I had each of them as attributes for the transaction entity and these would be purchased during the transaction. Because food is also fed to pets, I also made a relationship between the food entity and the pet entity. I also established a relationship between pets and enclosures because the description states that the pets live inside them. For the relationship between transaction and pet, food, and enclosure, I placed an optional one to many relationship because a customer may not purchase an item that fall under one of those entities."
